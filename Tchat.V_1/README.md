## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `client`: the package containing the `Client` and `ClientHandler` class
- `server`: the package containing  the `Server` class


Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
